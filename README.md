# PCA-on-breast-cancer-dataset
PCA and Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify essential variables from the breast cancer dataset. The dataset is reduced to 2 PCA components. Additionally, logistic regression is implemented to predict cancer presence using the PCA components.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.
3. Open the `PCA on Cancer dataset.ipynb` script
4. Run the first line of code to execute PCA
5. Run the second line of code to execute logistic regression
4. Review the results printed in the console.
